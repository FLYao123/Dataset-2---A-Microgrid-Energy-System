# Dataset-2---A-Microgrid-Energy-System
A Dataset for Microgrid Energy System

This is an integrated district dataset which is main from Chong Aih’s MSc project, accessible on Github [1]. This open dataset contains hourly load, buying price (market price), selling price (simulated values[2]) and PV generation data of a microgrid in US. Also, the hourly carbon intensity data is from [3], which provides some carbon emission and intensity information related to the US electricity system.
